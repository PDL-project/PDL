- Subtask 2: (at robot1 drawer); (at robot1 spoon); (at-location spoon drawer); (holding robot1 spoon); (not (holding robot1 spoon)); (not (inaction robot1)); (not (object-open robot1 drawer)); (object-close robot1 drawer); (object-open robot1 drawer)

# GENERAL TASK DECOMPOSITION 
# Decompose and parallel subtasks where ever possible
# Independent subtasks:

# Initial condition analyze due to previous subtask:
#1. Robot not holding any object
#2. ButterKnife is on the counterTop
#3. Drawer is closed

# SubTask 2: Store the ButterKnife.
