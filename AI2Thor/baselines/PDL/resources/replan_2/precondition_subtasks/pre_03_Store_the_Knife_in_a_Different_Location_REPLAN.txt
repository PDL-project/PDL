# GENERAL TASK DECOMPOSITION 
# Decompose and parallel subtasks where ever possible
# Independent subtasks:

# Initial condition analyze due to previous subtask:
#1. Robot holding knife
#2. Robot not at drawer1 location
#3. drawer1 is initially closed

# SubTask 1: Store the Knife in a Different Location
