# GENERAL TASK DECOMPOSITION 
# Decompose and parallel subtasks where ever possible
# Independent subtasks:

# Initial condition analyze due to previous subtask:
#1. Robot holding knife
#2. Robot not at alternativeDrawer location
#3. alternativeDrawer is initially closed

# SubTask 1: Store the Knife in an Alternative Location
    Skills Required: GoToObject, PutObject, CloseObject
    Related Objects: knife(Location=robot1), alternativeDrawer(Location=floor)

GoToObject(robot1, alternativeDrawer)
   Preconditions:
     (not (inaction robot1))

   Preconditions:
     (not (inaction robot1))
     (at robot1 alternativeDrawer)
   Effects:
     (object-open robot1 alternativeDrawer)
